- 👋 Hi, I’m @velo1guy
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering, nature, making a difference and having fun along the way!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end web developement, 3d modeling, and trying to wrap my head around the math for mechanical engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything cool and interesting, my mind is open and i like learning new skills and helping others do the same
- 📫 How to reach me: I respond well from seeing then doing, see how you make a website and then try to make  my own, asking some questions. I'm learning a bit of web scraping from 
old Michael Reeves livestreams right now!
